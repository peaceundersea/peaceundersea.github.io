Over 70 million sharks are killed to satisfy our enormous demand EVERY YEAR !
	</br>
	</br>
	Now MALAYSIA has been identified as the world's 3rd largest trader for shark fin.
	</br>
	</br>
Shark fin soup has been a tradition at Chinese festive celebrations and wedding banquets.
</br>
</br>
But growing demand of shark fin soup is pushing our sharks to extinction and disrupting
the balance of our oceans.

<h1>Our most ancient species are endangered.</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	Sharks have existed since before the dinosaurs and pre-date humans
by hundreds of millions of years. Once kings of natural selection, sharks
are now facing extinction due to finning. 
	</br>
	</br>
Shark populations are extremely vulnerable because they take up
to 20 years to reach sexual maturity andproduce few young. 
</br>
</br>
The current demand for fins makes it impossible to 
restore populations to previous levels.
</br>
</br>
Since 1972, the number of Blacktip, Tiger, Bull, Dusky, and Smooth 
Hammerhead sharks has fallen by over 90%. 
</br></br>
Already, 18-20 species of sharks are listed as endangered
by the International Union for the  Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

<h1>The soup isn’t that good anyway.</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	Changes in shark populations alter the ecological dynamics within the entire ocean because sharks are apex predators and play a major role as ecological stabilizers.
	</br>
	</br>
The domino effect: decimated Blacktip and Tiger Shark populations along the east coast of the US led to decreased shellfish populations, which led to decreased water quality since shellfish filter water.

The domino effect: decimated Blacktip and Tiger Shark populations along the east coast of the US led to decreased shellfish populations, which led to decreased water quality since shellfish filter water. Another domino effect: fewer sharks increase octopus populations, which decrease lobster populations. At this rate, the oceanic ecosystem that has evolved over millions and millions of years would collapse.

<h1>This isn’t just in Asia.</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	Outside of Asia, California is the largest market for fins. The Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 prohibits the possession of fins without the corresponding carcass in U.S. waters but does not prohibit the importing or distribution of fins, so some of the fins that are legally imported through Los Angeles and San Diego are actually illegally obtained in U.S. waters.
</br></br>
	California Assembly Members Fong and Huffman have introduced Assembly Bill 376, a bill to ban the possession, sale, trade, and distribution of shark fins in California. 
</br></br>
	Washington, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands have already passed a similar law and Oregon and Guam are considering it.

<h1>Finning cashes in on cruelty..</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	Now that we’ve overfished the Bluefin Tuna, industry has turned to the sharks to cash in. Fins are worth up to $600 per pound. What happens when we overfish all of the sharks?
	</div>
</div>
	<div id="box8">
<div id="content7">
<h1>It’s a wasteful practice.</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	Usually, only the fin is saved while the rest of the shark’s body is chucked overboard. Shark meat isn’t popular because of the high ammonia content, meaning that the carcass must move quickly from sea to table with the utmost care to prevent health hazards to the consumer.
	</br>
	</br>
 Shark meat isn’t valuable enough for fishermen to carefully store the huge carcasses on their ships.

<h1>Longlining is killing more than sharks.</h1>
	</br>
	</br>
	A “curtain of death” sweeps through the ocean, catching anything that goes for the bait. These “longlines” are meant to catch tuna and swordfish, but they actually catch anything that takes its bait, including endangered sharks, leatherback and loggerhead turtles, and seabirds (such as albatross). 
	</br>
	</br>
Over 25% of the longline catch is chucked back into the sea, usually left for dead.
